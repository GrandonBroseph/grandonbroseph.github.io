    <p>In this game, the player's army faces off against the enemy in turn-based combat. The game ends once the commander on either side is defeated.</p>
    <p>Complexity is primarily derived from each unit's class, which determines its stats, attributes, and outcomes of interactions with other units. For instance, the thief (specified by a dagger icon) will always dodge attacks from the brute (axe), but the knight (shield) always blocks attacks from the thief. Applying these simple rules to specifically designed environmental hazards and enemy placement allows for a great number of strategic patterns to arise by default.</p>
    <p>This project has been one of my first forays into integrating UI mockups into a game. I've learned to develop state-heavy, animation-driven, and scalable applications.</p>
