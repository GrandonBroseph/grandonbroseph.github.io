> Ongoing draft for my website.

[Take it for a spin via GitHub Pages!](https://git.io/grandon)

## Overview

A small, static portfolio website written primarily in [Pug](https://github.com/pugjs/pug) and [Sass](https://github.com/sass/sass), with interactivity powered by [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue). Contains demos of some interesting projects I've made in the past.

## Meta
`npm install`: Download `devDependencies` and initialize development mode.
`npm start`: Initialize development mode manually.

Source is still very messy. I'll clean it up someday.
